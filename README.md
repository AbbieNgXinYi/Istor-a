## Video Installation

1) In our setup, we are using two laptops. 1 laptop per 2 stations. They are powered using the power adapter.

2) From 1 of our laptop, we connected LAN cable to the Media Server.

3)In order to use Christie Pandora Box **( A projection mapping software )**, we requrire a liicence for both the media server and the laptop.

4) From the Media Server, we had to use HDMI Extender **( Both TX and RX )** to one of the projector( 1st station ) via HDMI to LAN cable. Repeat the same step for the second projector( 2nd station ).

## **Audio Installation**

## **Lighting Installation**
1) From our setup, we connect to the Light DMX Driver via HDMI to DMX cable. 

2) Ensure that there is power to power on the DMX Driver if not the light **( LED Strips )** would not be turned on. *[Light is mainly used to tell audience where the 1st station is till the end]*
