## Storyboard

<br>

### Station 1

![Alt text](henrystdsb/station1.jpg)

* From the image above is our station 1 storyboard. It depicts the mayor grand opening of the museum, while showcasing the **priceless diamond**. It then pans out to show the main character, Henry, who plans to steal the **priceless diamond** to pay off his late rent of the house.

<br>

### Station 2


* At the start of station 2, it shows you **6 different options** for you to choose from. There  are **2 different scenerios (A and B)** from here. 

![Alt text](/StoryboardPics/IMG_20230715_144256.jpg)

* From **scene A**, there are **3 options** to select from and *1 of them* is ***CORRECT***. If **WRONG**, the retry scene will *replay* until you picked the right choice. When the right option is selected, the next scene will be where you had successfully entered the museum, and is planning on how to bypass  2 guards, with **3 additional options + 1 timer**. The retry scene will *replay* until the right option is selected. Once the right option is selected, the scene will end off where you successfully bypass 2 guards and is now planning on how to bypass the 3rd guard, while you are getting closer to the diamond.

![Alt text](/StoryboardPics/scenario%20B%20st2/scenario%20B%20st2_1.jpg)

* From **scene B**, there are **3 options** to select and *1 of them* is ***CORRECT***. The retry menu will *replay* when **Wrong option** is picked. If the right option is selected,  the next scene will bring you to the roof of the museum where you are given another **4 options** to bypass the guard. When you picked the wrong option, the retry scene will *replay* until you picked the right choice. Once you selected the right option, the scene will end off where you successfully bypass the guard and entered the museum from the rooftop, and is now planning on how to steal the diamond from the catwalk above.

<br>

### Station 3

![Alt text](/StoryboardPics/IMG_20230715_144245.jpg)

Following up from Station 2 of **scene A**, you start off with bypassing 1 guard thats guarding the door. You are given **2 options**. If fail, retry scene will play. If not, you will proceed on infront of the door, towards to the diamond. You are now given additional **4 options**. The retry scene will replay if you selected the **wrong option**. Once the right option is picked, the scene will end off where the Chaos Agency is notified of the Chaos happening in the museum.

![Alt text](/StoryboardPics/scenario%20B%20st3/scenario%20B%20st3_1.jpg)

* For **scene B**, you are given **3 options** to get closer to the diamond. If ***Wrong option*** is picked, the retry scene will *replay* until the right option is selected. When the right option is selected, the next scene will be how you plan to steal the diamond by giving you **2 additional options** to select from. The selection interface will *replay* until the right option is selected. After successfully stealing the diamond, you now stuck in a corridor with 2guards thats near an exit door. From here, you are given **3 options** to choose from. If fail, retry scene will *replay* until the the **right option** is picked. Once the **right option** is picked, the scene will end off where u have to bypass 1 more guard.

<br>

### Station 4

![Alt text](/StoryboardPics/IMG_20230714_222821.jpg)

* For **scene A**, the scene starts off with the user selecting from their given **4 options**. The replay scene will *replay* until the right option is selected. Once the right option is selected, the next scene will be where you are escaping from all the Chaos that is happening in the museum, without the diamond. However, at the end of the scene, the diamond had sucessfully flew from the museum and landed next to you. *Task finished Successfully?*

![Alt text](/StoryboardPics/scenario%20B%20st4/scenario%20B%20st4_1.jpg)

* For **scene B**, the scene starts off where you had to bypass 1 guard that has a weapon in hand. You are given **4 options** to pick from. If fail, the replay scene will *replay* until the right option is picked. If the right option is picked, the scene will end off where you had successfully stole the diamond from the museum undetected.

  * 2 Media Server
  * 2 Dongle (Christie Pandora Box License)
  * 1 Network Switch

2) In our setup, there will be 1 laptop, 2 media server and 1 Dongle for each media server. 
   There will be 1 projector for every 1 station.

   ![Alt text](315Images/MS1.jpg)

3) Both media servers and Laptop are all interconnected to a network switch via LAN. Each projector is connected to the media server via HDMI.
 
4) In our setup, we have used a pair of HDMI extender due to the location of where the media server and one of the projector is placed. If the location of your equipment is not far from each other, there is no need to use HDMI extenders.

5) If you too want to ensure proper and stable cable management in your setup, you may consider using HDMI extenders.
    * Help reduce hardware issues that relate to the cabling like:
        1) lose connection 
        2) Cable being pulled out
    * Extenders run on LAN cables for extension
        1) LAN cables have a locking mechanism while HDMI cables do not. This ensures that aren't lose or pulled out easily.

6) We are using a software called **Christie Pandora Box**(projection mapping software) to project out our content. 
   To use it, you will need to accquire a dongle that has their license to operate the software. 

7) The dongle is plugged into one of the USB-A ports in the media server.
    ![Alt text](315Images/VD1.jpg)

#### Back
![Alt text](Interacting/photo_2023-06-07_02-14-42.jpg)


From Stations 2 to 4, users will be able to pick options that will lead to two different paths. One path is labelled "A" while the other is labelled "B". Users should then follow the labelling and numberings and choose the options in order.

![Alt text](Interacting/MVP%20documentation%20Images/Station%202%20interactivity%20plus%20label.jpg)

Users can pick any option first. After picking users are advised to keep to one path as deferring would result in a break in the flow of the story. 

Station 2 First Choice:
