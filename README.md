* From the image above is our station 1 storyboard. It depicts the mayor grand opening of the museum, while showcasing the **priceless diamond**. It then pans out to show the main character, Henry, who plans to steal the **priceless diamond** to pay off his late rent of the house.

<br>

### Station 2


* At the start of station 2, it shows you **6 different options** for you to choose from. There  are **2 different scenerios (A and B)** from here. 

![Alt text](/StoryboardPics/IMG_20230715_144256.jpg)

* From **scene A**, there are **3 options** to select from and *1 of them* is ***CORRECT***. If **WRONG**, the retry scene will *replay* until you picked the right choice. When the right option is selected, the next scene will be where you had successfully entered the museum, and is planning on how to bypass  2 guards, with **3 additional options + 1 timer**. The retry scene will *replay* until the right option is selected.
  
* Once the right option is selected, the scene will end off where you successfully bypass 2 guards and is now planning on how to bypass the 3rd guard, while you are getting closer to the diamond.

![Alt text](/StoryboardPics/scenario%20B%20st2/scenario%20B%20st2_1.jpg)

* From **scene B**, there are **3 options** to select and *1 of them* is ***CORRECT***. The retry menu will *replay* when **Wrong option** is picked. If the right option is selected,  the next scene will bring you to the roof of the museum where you are given another **4 options** to bypass the guard. When you picked the wrong option, the retry scene will *replay* until you picked the right choice.
  
* Once you selected the right option, the scene will end off where you successfully bypass the guard and entered the museum from the rooftop, and is now planning on how to steal the diamond from the catwalk above.

<br>

### Station 3

![Alt text](/StoryboardPics/IMG_20230715_144245.jpg)

Following up from Station 2 of **scene A**, you start off with bypassing 1 guard thats guarding the door. You are given **2 options**. If fail, retry scene will play. If not, you will proceed on infront of the door, towards to the diamond. 

* You are now given additional **4 options**. The retry scene will replay if you selected the **wrong option**. Once the right option is picked, the scene will end off where the Chaos Agency is notified of the Chaos happening in the museum.

![Alt text](/StoryboardPics/scenario%20B%20st3/scenario%20B%20st3_1.jpg)

## Installation
### Video System

1)Equipment needed:
  * 1 Laptop
  * 4 Projectors
  * 2 Media Server
  * 2 Dongle (Christie Pandora Box License)
  * 1 Network Switch

2) In our setup, there will be 1 laptop, 2 media server and 1 Dongle for each media server. 
   There will be 1 projector for every 1 station.

   ![Alt text](315Images/MS1.jpg)

3) Both media servers and Laptop are all interconnected to a network switch via LAN. Each projector is connected to the media server via HDMI.
 
4) In our setup, we have used a pair of HDMI extender due to the location of where the media server and one of the projector is placed. If the location of your equipment is not far from each other, there is no need to use HDMI extenders.

5) If you too want to ensure proper and stable cable management in your setup, you may consider using HDMI extenders.
    * Help reduce hardware issues that relate to the cabling like:
        1) lose connection 
        2) Cable being pulled out
    * Extenders run on LAN cables for extension
        1) LAN cables have a locking mechanism while HDMI cables do not. This ensures that aren't lose or pulled out easily.

6) We are using a software called **Christie Pandora Box**(projection mapping software) to project out our content. 
   To use it, you will need to accquire a dongle that has their license to operate the software. 

7) The dongle is plugged into one of the USB-A ports in the media server.
    ![Alt text](315Images/VD1.jpg)
  
8) After stations 1 and 2 are completed, repeat the same steps for stations 3 and 4.

* Equipment needed:
  + 4 speakers (JBL Control 23)
  + 1 ampliflier (Crown CT875)
  + 1 dante interface (AXI 44AT)
  + 1 laptop
  + 1 Network Switch

1) In our setup, we will be using 4 passive speakers, 1 ampliflier, 1 dante interface and 1 laptop. 1 speaker is connected for each station and all 4 of them will be connected to an ampliflier crown CT875 as this ampliflier has 4 different channels.

2) All 4 speakers are connected to the ampliflier using speaker cable, each speaker is connected to 1 channel on the amplifier
![Alt text](315Images/AIN1.jpg)

<br>

4) Turn the Input Attenuation knok to 0 dB.

![Alt text](315Images/photo_6053084928981186287_y.jpg)

5) The audio assets are wav. files which are generated from the mp4 video assets using Pandora box's Media Encoder.

6) The sampling rate is set at 48kHz which is the same sampling rate that is set on the Dante Network.

7) Audio assets were placed on the Pandora Box's timeline.

8) We have set the Pandora Box audio output to be configured to PB dante as we will be using a dante interface to route our audio.

9) To use the dante interface, connect it to the laptop. If the laptop LAN port is unavailable, a network switch is required.

10) Next, connect the audio amplifier's 4 inputs use according to this setup to the outputs of the dante interface. For this project, we have connected using LAN cables to carry our audio signal.

11) The analog output from dante interface will send audio to the 8 channel crown amplifier
  
12) To route our audio, we required the use of the Dante Virtual Soundcard and Dante Controller.

13) The Dante Virtual Soundcard is used to output network audio from the laptop.

14) The Dante Controller is used to route audio.

## Interactivity

### Introduction
To start, users can scan a QR code that we generated for each station which will bring them to an infographic. The infographic will let users know more about our project as well as instructions on how to play. Every Station has a QR code located close to it for users to scan and it will bring them to the corresponding infographics.

Interactivity for Station 1:
![Alt text](Interacting/FP%20documentation%20Images/Station%201%20Gamebox.jpg)

We have a button and a Rotary potentiometer. The button is used to start the station, while the Rotary potentiometer is to reset the station as well as a backup for if the button fails.

#### Side View
![Alt text](Interacting/POC%20documentation%20Images/photo_2023-06-07_02-13-41.jpg)

For the button and Rotary potentiometer to work, we used a Phiget Interface 8/8/8 kit to power, transmit and receive protocols from PB.

#### Shadow Puppetry Element
This station has a shadow puppetery element. This shadow puppetery is achieved by attaching a model to a servo motor.

![Alt text](Interacting/POC%20documentation%20Images/photo_2023-06-07_02-14-31.jpg)

This servo motor is timed on PB using WD for it to move into position and move away at the right moment while the video is running.

**Video of servo motor in action:**
*[Video can be found in the Interacting Folder - Station_1_servo_moving]*


**Video of how servo motor affects video:** 
*[Video can be found in the Interacting Folder - Station_1_servo_effect]*


The servo motor is being driven by a **PhidgetAdvancedServo 8-Motor** which is a servo controller.

Button and Scanner:
![Alt text](Interacting/FP%20documentation%20Images/Station%202%20Gamebox.jpg)


For this station's interactivity, we used RFID, buttons and rotary potentiometer.

#### Side View

![Alt text](Interacting/POC%20documentation%20Images/photo_2023-06-07_02-14-23.jpg)

For station 2, we used RFID tags to let users pick their choices for the game. Throughout our stations, we used card RFID tags, keychain RFID tags as well as disk RFID tags

![Alt text](Interacting/MVP%20documentation%20Images/RFID%20Tags.jpg)


We put cardboard cutouts of the ingame options onto the RFID tags which help to label and hide the tags


#### Front

#### Back

From Stations 2 to 4, users will be able to pick options that will lead to two different paths. One path is labelled "A" while the other is labelled "B". Users should then follow the labelling and numberings and choose the options in order.

![Alt text](Interacting/MVP%20documentation%20Images/Station%202%20interactivity%20plus%20label.jpg)

Users can pick any option first. After picking users are advised to keep to one path as deferring would result in a break in the flow of the story. 

Station 2 Path A Props:

![Alt text](Interacting/FP%20documentation%20Images/Station%202%20A%20Props.jpg)

Station 2 Path B Props:
![Alt text](Interacting/FP%20documentation%20Images/Station%202%20B%20Props.jpg)


For users to select their choice, they would have to use these RFID tags and tap it on the RFID Scanner. This would jump the video to  play the option which users have selected. 

![Alt text](Interacting/POC%20documentation%20Images/photo_2023-06-07_02-14-45.jpg)


For every group of options, only one of them is correct. When users select the wrong option, the video shown to them will be a fail screen. They will then be brought back to the point just before they made their inital decision and will be able to make another choice.

After choosing the right answer, the video will progress the story and give users context of the next station before they have to move on the the 3rd station.

![Alt text](Interacting/FP%20documentation%20Images/Station%203%20Props.jpg)

To continue on their journey after breaking in, users must first press the button which resonates with the options which they picked in Station 2.

For example, if they pick a prop from Path A in Station 2, they would press the button labelled "A" on the gamebox at Station 3. 

If users are unsure, the video at the end of Station 2 will tell them to move on to the next station (Station 3) as well as which button to press when they arrive at Station 3.

Similar to Station 3, users must first press the button which resonates with the options which they picked in Station 3 before they can escape with their bounty.

For example, if they pick a prop from Path A in Station 3, they would press the button labelled "A" on the gamebox at Station 4. 

If users are unsure, the video at the end of Station 3 will tell them to move on to the next station (Station 4) as well as which button to press when they arrive at Station 4.
