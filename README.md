## Video Installation

1) In our setup, we are using two laptops. 1 laptop per 2 stations. They are powered using the power adapter.

2) From 1 of our laptops, we connect via LAN cable to the Media Server.

3) In order to use Christie Pandora Box **( A projection mapping software )**, we require a licence for both the media server and the laptop.

4) From the Media Server, we had to use HDMI Extender **( Both TX and RX )** to one of the projector( 1st station ) via HDMI to LAN cable. Repeat the same step for the second projector( 2nd station ).

## **Audio Installation**

---
## **Lighting Installation**
1) From our setup, we connect to the Light DMX Driver via HDMI to DMX cable. 

2) Ensure that there is power to power on the DMX Driver if not the light **( LED Strips )** would not be turned on. *[Light is mainly used to tell audience where the 1st station is till the end]*

## Control Installation

---
# Operational Phase:
## Christie Pandora Box
---

1) **After downloading the Christie Pandora Box and Christie Pandora Server Management, you would need to buy the licence in order to run the pandora box**

2) **After having both the licence and the pandora box, open up the pandora server management, in the server management, you need to open the media server *(Direct connection from laptop to the media server with licence)*.**

3) **Afterwards, you can open the Pandora Box application, both laptop and the server management, create new project, and add video assets into the media server. Ensure that the video assets are on different layers and that the layers are not hidden**

4) **In order to mesh the video output to fit the screen output, you would need to right click on the folder, rename it for easy recognition, and mesh it to fit the screen that you are projecting the video onto.**

## **Props used for interaction**
---

1) **The props below is for the audience to use to interact when they have to select different options to progress the storyline**

2) **The pickaxe is used to proceed the storyline(the right answer).**

3) **The other 2 options are the wrong answers where the video will proceed to play other scenerios until the right answers are chosen.**
