## Storyboard
<br>

### Station 1

![Alt text](henrystdsb/station1.jpg)
* From the image above is our station 1 storyboard. It depicts the mayor grand opening of the museum, while showcasing the **priceless diamond**. It then pans out to show the main character, Henry, who plans to steal the **priceless diamond** to pay off his late rent of the house.

<br>

### Station 2

![Alt text](henrystdsb/station2.jpg)
* From the image above is our storyboard of station 2. It shows **6 different options** for you to choose from. There  are **2 different scenerios (A and B)** from here. 

* From **scene A**, there are **3 options** to select from and *1 of them* is ***CORRECT***. If **WRONG**, the selection menu will *replay* until you picked the right choice. When the right option is selected, the next scene will be where you had successfully entered the museum, and is planning on how to bypass  2 guards, with **3 additional options + 1 timer**. The selection interface will *replay* until the right option is selected. Once the right option is selected, the scene will end off where you successfully bypass the guards and is now planning on how to steal the diamond.

* From **scene B**, there are **3 options** to select and *1 of them* is ***CORRECT***. The selection menu will *replay* when **Wrong option** is picked. If the right option is selected,  the next scene will bring you to the roof of the museum where you are given another **4 options** to bypass the guard. When you picked the wrong option, the selection interface will *replay* until you picked the right choice. Once you selected the right option, the scene will end off where you successfully bypass the guard and entered the museum from the rooftop, and is now planning on how to steal the diamond.

<br>

### Station 3

![Alt text](henrystdsb/station3.jpg)
* Following up from Station 2 of **scene A**, you are given **4 options**. The selection interface will replay if you selected the **wrong option**. Once the right option is picked, the scene will end off where the Chaos Agency is notified of the Chaos happening in the museum.

* For **scene B**, you are given **3 options** to get closer to the diamond. If ***Wrong option*** is picked, the selection interface will *replay* until the right option is selected. When the right option is selected, the next scene will be how you plan to steal the diamond by giving you **2 additional options** to select from. The selection interface will *replay* until the right option is selected. Once you select the right option, the scene will end off you stealing the diamond before trying to escape the museum with it.

<br>

### Station 4

![Alt text](henrystdsb/station4.jpg)
* For **scene A**, the scene starts off with the Chaos Agency being notofied of the Chaos happening in the museum, and is given **4 options** to select from. The selection interface will *replay* until the right option is selected. Once the right option is selected, the next scene will be where you are escaping from the Chaos that the Chaos Agency had dispatched to, without the diamond. However, at the end of the scene, the diamond had sucessfully flew from the museum and landed next to you. *Task finished Successfully?*

* For **scene B**, the scene starts off where you had to bypass another 2 guards and with the diamond in tow, you are given **3 options**. If fail, the selection interface will *replay* until the right option is selected. Once the right option is picked, the next scene will be you outside the museum with the diamond , but still have to bypass 1 more guard with a gun. You are given **additional 4 options** to pick from. If fail, the selection interface will *replay* until the right option is picked.

## Installation
### Video System

1)Equipment needed:
  * 2 Laptops
  * 4 Projectors
  * 2 Media Server
  * 2 Dongle (Christie Pandora Box License)

2) In our setup, there will be 1 laptop, 1 media server and 1 Dongle for every 2 stations. 
   There will be 1 projector for every 1 station.

   ![Alt text](315Images/MS1.jpg)

3) Each laptop is connected to the media server via LAN. Each projector is connected to the media server via HDMI.
 
4) In our setup, we have used a pair of HDMI extender due to the location of where the media server and one of the projector is placed. If the location of your equipment is not far from each other, there is no need to use HDMI extenders.

5) If you too want to ensure proper and stable cable management in your setup, you may consider using HDMI extenders.
    * Help reduce hardware issues that relate to the cabling like:
        1) lose connection 
        2) Cable being pulled out
    * Extenders run on LAN cables for extension
        1) LAN cables have a locking mechanism while HDMI cables do not. This ensures that aren't lose or pulled out easily.

6) We are using a software called **Christie Pandora Box**(projection mapping software) to project out our content. 
   To use it, you will need to accquire a dongle that has their license to operate the software. 

7) The dongle is plugged into one of the USB-A ports in the media server.
    ![Alt text](315Images/VD1.jpg)
  
8) After stations 1 and 2 are completed, repeat the same steps for stations 3 and 4.

### Audio System
1)Equipment needed:
  * 4 speakers
  * 1 ampliflier

1) In our setup, we will be using 4 passive speakers, 1 for each station and all 4 of them will be connected to an ampliflier crown CT875 as this ampliflier has 4 different channels.

2) Passive speakers are used instead of active speakers as they dont have to be plugged in which will reduce the amount of cables used by half.

3) Mono sound is used as it only uses 1 channel compared to stereo which uses 2 which will increase the cost as another ampliflier would be needed.

4) Each speaker is connected to one channel on the amplifier.

![Alt text](315Images/ACH1.jpg)

3) The laptop is connected to the amplifier's input 1 and 2 using a 3.5mm audio cable to terminal block.

![Alt text](315Images/AIN1.jpg)

4) Switch on the power button of the Crown CT875 Amplifier. 
Wait for about a few minutes until the "signal" and the "ready" light lit up (in green).

### Lighting System

1) In our setup, we will be using a software called **grandMA3** to program our lights.

2) To use the software, we need a **grandMA3 Node**. 

   ![Alt text](LightImg/NodeImg.jpg)

3) This node is connected to the laptop via a usb to dmx adapter and dmx cable.

4) In our setup, we are using LED strips. To connect the LED strips the the node, we have used a Light DMX driver.

5) This Light DMX Driver is connected to the node via HDMI to DMX cable. 
    The other end is connected to the LED strips via terminal block.
    ![Alt text](LightImg/DMXdriver.png)

6) Do note that the driver and node do require power to function

7) Our lighting system will be used to give users a more immersive and responsive experience by responding to their choices.
    *[e.g If they fail, the lights will turn red.]*

### Control System
#### Phidget Control System

#### Stations 1 & 2
**In this setup, we will are using 2 Phidget interfaces, 1 Phidget RFID and 1 Phidget Advance servo 8-Motor. 
  The interface we are using is the phidget interface 8/8/8.**

* Note: We have used USB Extenders and HUB due to where the different equipment are placed and insufficent USB-A ports

##### Station 1

1) The sensors we have in station 1 are:
    * 1 Rotary potentiometer
    * 1 Button
    * 1 Phidget Advance servo 8-Motor
    * 1 RC servo motor

2) The Phidget interface and Phidget Advance servo 8-Motor are connected to the laptop via USB-B to USB-A cable. 
   We are using a usb extension in our setup due to the location of where the interface, servo motor and laptop are place.

3) The phidget interface consists of 8 digital and analog inputs.

4) The Rotary potentiometer is connected to one analog input, the Button is connected to one digital input.

7) The Button is to enable for the video to start

8) While the Rotary potentiometer is there as a backup for the button, it also enables the content to be replayable 
  through our program.

9) The Phidget Advance servo 8-Motor is connected seperately from the interface.

10) The RC servo motor is connected to 1 channel in the Phidget Advance servo 8-Motor.

5) For the interactivity to work, we will be using an application called **Widget Designer** to program the button and sensor.

6) To use Widget Designer, you will need to download the application if not downloaded.

7) Program Files can be found under **WD Files** in this GitHub Repository


##### Station 2

1) The sensors we have in station 2 are:
    * 1 Phidget RIFD 
    * 3 Phidget RFID Tags
    * 1 Button
    * 1 Rotary potentiometer

2) The Phidget interface and the Phidget RFID are connected to the laptop via USB-B to USB-A cable. We are using a usb extension in our setup due to the location of where the Phidget interface, Phidget RFID and laptop are placed.

3) The phidget interface consists of 8 digital and analog inputs.

4) The Rotary potentiometer is connected to one analog input, the Button is connected to one digital input.

5) The Phidget RFID is connected to the laptop seperately from the interface.

6) The Button is to enable for the video to start

7) While the Rotary potentiometer is there as a backup for the button, it also enables the content to be replayable 
  through our program.

8) The Phidget RFID has RFID tags for object selection in our content. Each RFID tag is assigned an RFID id.

9) The RFID scanner will read the tag's id and jump to a specific scene (the choice made by the user) and play it.

10) For the interactivity to work, we will be using an application called **Widget Designer** to program the button and sensor.

11) To use Widget Designer, you will need to download the application if not downloaded.

12) Program Files that has been used for out project can be found under **WD Files** in this GitHub Repository.

## Interactivity

### Station 1
1) This is the set up for station 1:

![Alt text](Interacting/photo_2023-06-07_02-14-01.jpg)

We have a button and a Rotary potentiometer. The button is used to start the station, while the Rotary potentiometer is to reset the station as well as a backup for if the button fails.

#### Side View
![Alt text](Interacting/photo_2023-06-07_02-13-41.jpg)

For the button and Rotary potentiometer to work, we used a Phiget Interface 8/8/8 kit to power, transmit and receive protocols from PB. 

![Alt text](Interacting/photo_2023-06-07_02-13-46.jpg)

#### Shadow Puppetry Element
This station has a shadow puppetery element. This shadow puppetery is achieved by attaching a model to a servo motor.

![Alt text](Interacting/photo_2023-06-07_02-14-31.jpg)

This servo motor is timed on PB using WD for it to move into position and move away at the right moment while the video is running.

**Video of servo motor in action:**
*[Video can be found in the Interacting Folder - Station_1_servo_moving]*


**Video of how servo motor affects video:** 
*[Video can be found in the Interacting Folder - Station_1_servo_effect]*


The servo motor is being driven by a **PhidgetAdvancedServo 8-Motor** which is a servo controller.

![Alt text](Interacting/photo_2023-06-07_02-13-51.jpg)


#### Station 2

This is the set up for station 2:

![Alt text](Interacting/photo_2023-06-07_02-13-57.jpg)

For this station's interactivity, we used RFID, buttons and rotary potentiometer. 

#### Side View

![Alt text](Interacting/photo_2023-06-07_02-14-23.jpg)

For station 2, we used RFID tags to let users pick their choices for the game. 

![Alt text](Interacting/photo_2023-06-07_02-14-49.jpg)


For users to select their choice, they would have to use these RFID disks and tap it on the RFID reader. This would jump the video to  play the option which users have selected. 

![Alt text](Interacting/photo_2023-06-07_02-14-45.jpg)

To help with the identification of the disk, we made cut outs of the options given to the users and stuck the RFID disks to to back of the cut outs. 

#### Front
![Alt text](Interacting/photo_2023-06-07_02-14-40.jpg)

#### Back
![Alt text](Interacting/photo_2023-06-07_02-14-42.jpg)


Out of the three options, only one of them is correct *[the middle option **(pick)**]*. When users select the wrong option, the video shown to them will be a fail screen. 

After choosing the right answer, the video will progress the story and give users context of the next station before they have to move on the the 3rd station.

![Alt text](Interacting/whiteBTN.png)

The Rotary potentiometer for this station resets the station as well as act as a backup for if the button fails to work.
